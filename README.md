# pi.py
Iterates over a range of numbers, checking to see if and where each one occurs in the number pi.

The file "pi-10000.txt" contains the first ten thousand digits of pi, which the script uses to search over. The first billion digits of pi is available at http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/contrib/pi/ or direct from http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/pi-billion.txt (953 MB).
